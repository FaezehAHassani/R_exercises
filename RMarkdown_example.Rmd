## R Markdown

`r 3 + 4`

I have `r apple` apples.

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

```{r}
source("test_for_RMarkdown.R")
print(fruits)
cat(fruits)
```

This is my fruits list:
`r fruits` 

```{r list_example, echo = FALSE}
markdown_list <- "
- Lion
- Tigers
- Bears
- Oh mys
"
```

`r markdown_list`



## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
